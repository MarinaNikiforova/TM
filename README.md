# TM
# Time Management Sprint 2

In this sprint I have added T-shirt sizes for each project. User can now give sizes to each project they are working on 
by typing: java TM size <project name> <size> with sizes varying from XS (extra small) to XL (extra large). In the future 
these sizes can be used to gauge one's productivity factor and help better estimate how much time a particular taks may take.

Major difficulties in this sprint for me was to re-structure my data structures to use ArrayList to be able to read summary 
back from file and be able to add more than one-line description to each task. Most problems were resolved by using StackOverflow 
and StackExchange with some added advice from fellow-developers.
